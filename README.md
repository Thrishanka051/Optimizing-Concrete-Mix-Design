# Optimizing-Concrete-Mix-Design
The objective of this study is to optimize the concrete mix design by balancing compressive strength and material costs. By analyzing the relationships between various concrete components and their impact on strength, the goal is to find the most cost-effective mix that still meets required strength standards.
